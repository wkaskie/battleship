# Warship (like Battleship, hopefully without copyright infringement)
A backend and frontend built to mock the gameplay of battleship.

Terraform for the IaC to build AWS ECS and dependencies.

The contents of "server" serve an api that renders a battleship grid and places "ships" randomly. It has an endpoint to check a set of coords for a "hit".

index.js controls the mock-gameplay functions.

I think I'll build out a React Front end and make it playable (in progress)...removing the copyrighted aspects, of course. ;-)
