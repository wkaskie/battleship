# Battleship
A backend built to mock the gameplay of battleship

The contents of "server" serve an api that renders a battleship grid and places "ships" randomly. It has an endpoint to check a set of coords for a "hit".

index.js controls the mock-gameplay functions.

I think I'll build out a React Front end and make it playable...removing the copyrighted aspects, of course. ;-)
